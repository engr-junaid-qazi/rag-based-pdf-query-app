* Create Embeddings 
* Use FAISS as a Vector Database to store Vector Embeddings
* Use Opensource LLM model from GROQ 

Created a RAG based Generative AI application. The user will upload a document in pdf format, after that the code will read and extract the pdf document, create chunks, tokenize them, create embeddings and store them in a vector DB like FAISS. Database will be open source.
